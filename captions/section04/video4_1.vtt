All right we're about to start developing our own applications where rabid MQ.

00:08.490 --> 00:14.820
And before we dig into our development section let's go where what we're going to do in this section

00:16.260 --> 00:22.160
in this section we will learn how to use Rabbitt template for spraying this.

00:22.170 --> 00:26.450
Robert Templer is the beautiful and simple way to use rabbit.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.890
Q With spring and job of course.

00:28.890 --> 00:34.320
So we're going to make use of it extensively in our sections and I'll show you all the methods of it

00:34.500 --> 00:35.550
in our sections.

00:35.550 --> 00:42.850
When were developing our applications and next we're going to learn how to publish messages with Rabbitte

00:42.850 --> 00:51.790
template and spring and Jawa and then we're going to configure our Qs and then we're going to configure

00:51.790 --> 00:54.550
our topics and routing between them.

00:56.820 --> 01:02.490
After reconfigure our queue's topics and routing We're of course going to learn how to configure our

01:02.490 --> 01:06.110
own exchanges from the actual Java code.

01:06.240 --> 01:14.760
And of course making use of spring dependency injection after we finish with configuring our exchanges

01:14.760 --> 01:21.540
topics and queues we're going to configure our listener to listen to messages coming from exchanges.

01:21.540 --> 01:30.570
And finally by cue's after we learned how to use Rabbitte template and configure our Qs Xchange and

01:30.570 --> 01:37.680
topics we're going to combine all of our knowledge in the section and we're going to both send and receive

01:37.680 --> 01:39.120
messages from rabidity.

01:39.120 --> 01:45.960
Q Broecker So this section is going to be a very useful section to learn how things work with rabid

01:45.980 --> 01:54.540
MQ both using Java and spring so I encourage you to watch these lectures very carefully and try to implement

01:54.690 --> 01:55.930
while watching them.

01:57.430 --> 02:01.450
So to start with using Rabbitt template I'll be seeing you in the next video.
