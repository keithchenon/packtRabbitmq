00:01.340 --> 00:08.300
So we're getting used to using the exchange builder to build builder way of creating exchanges.

00:09.300 --> 00:16.560
To implement a more advanced topic Exchange let's use the builder method and see what we can do with

00:16.560 --> 00:17.580
it.

00:17.640 --> 00:21.170
So I'll go down and I'll create a bean.

00:21.450 --> 00:35.600
And again I'll say I want an exchange and that exchange is going to be a new exchange and insight the

00:35.870 --> 00:48.840
Xchange builder I'll say Xchange builder The Opt. topic Exchange and the name of my Xchange is my going

00:48.840 --> 00:50.370
to be topic

00:53.810 --> 00:54.950
testy exchange

00:59.120 --> 01:12.500
and then I can provide again internal all delete durability delayed creation of my Xchange ignore declaration

01:12.500 --> 01:21.940
exceptions and with some arguments again and with a map of arguments as an option.

01:23.380 --> 01:34.390
So for my Xchange I can definitely say I want an auto delete Xchange and as the durability I can provide

01:35.860 --> 01:47.560
true as my durability and I can say internal and I can even provide some arguments for my topic exchange

01:47.560 --> 01:55.070
builder but this time I'm simply going to build it and let's see what's going to happen.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.620
Let's read on our application

02:02.230 --> 02:06.710
or application starting up.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.320
And here we go.

02:09.560 --> 02:18.070
Let's take all the logs and we should see that our topic exchange is created in rabit him.

02:18.080 --> 02:29.850
Q Let's go back to dashboard and from there we should see that our test topic exchange is created as

02:29.850 --> 02:40.770
you can see here and if we go inside it it is durable set as auto delete and internal is also true just

02:40.770 --> 02:46.030
like that topic exchange creation with the builder method.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.900
As simple as that.
