Let's take a look at what we're going to cover in the section in this section using Jowa and spring

00:09.260 --> 00:18.320
of course we will learn how to configure Qs with actual code not from any dashboard or rabbit.

00:18.320 --> 00:30.340
MQ Seelye and then we'll learn how to configure topic fan out direct or header's exchanges from actual

00:30.340 --> 00:31.400
code again.

00:31.630 --> 00:41.650
We will learn how to implement those with beans and other types and after that we're going to configure

00:41.860 --> 00:45.020
bindings between queues and exchanges.

00:47.010 --> 00:49.920
And learn how to do with actual code again.

00:51.150 --> 00:57.400
This is a really crucial part for routing keys and topic exchanges.

00:57.390 --> 01:02.850
And so we have to learn how to bind our cues and exchanges from code.

01:03.300 --> 01:09.240
Because again we may not have access to our dashboard anytime we want.

01:09.360 --> 01:14.060
So we should know how to configure them.

01:14.100 --> 01:22.620
After that we're going to realize an asynchronous communication scenario using two different applications.

01:22.620 --> 01:29.590
Remember the application that we first used as sending messages to exchanges and queues.

01:29.670 --> 01:32.470
When we first started developing applications.

01:32.760 --> 01:40.790
So we're going to use that application to send a message to an exchange indirectly to a Q of course

01:41.100 --> 01:47.870
and then we're going to be listening to that message as synchronously from another application.

01:49.830 --> 01:54.330
So it's going to be really fun and I'll be seeing you on the next video.
