00:01.720 --> 00:08.000
How about creating Xchange is from code to take a closer look at it.

00:08.050 --> 00:17.710
Let's create another configuration class and declare our exchanges and for the naming purposes I'll

00:17.710 --> 00:19.900
say rabbit.

00:19.900 --> 00:25.260
MQ Xchange configuration.

00:25.390 --> 00:26.440
Here we go.

00:26.630 --> 00:32.320
And again I'm going to annotate my class as configuration.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.040
All right.

00:34.440 --> 00:40.070
We already know a way to create exchanges in rabbit Q Using Java and spraying.

00:40.320 --> 00:43.450
And let's try that again.

00:44.400 --> 00:52.460
We are creating a bean for our exchange and we're simply implementing the Xchange interface from AM

00:52.590 --> 00:56.260
Cupie core and for the method name.

00:56.820 --> 00:59.660
And again it's irrelevant for our purpose.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.590
We can provide anything.

01:01.920 --> 01:06.120
And again I'm going to provide the example exchange.

01:06.810 --> 01:07.510
All right.

01:10.720 --> 01:18.820
Now for the exchange creation remember that we created a new exchange and simply returned it.

01:18.820 --> 01:29.650
So for this purpose for the Xchange creation remember that the exchange is an interface so we can't

01:29.650 --> 01:32.980
just initialize or create a new instance of it.

01:33.220 --> 01:36.140
So we have to pick the exchange.

01:36.160 --> 01:44.830
We have to pick the actual exchange implementation as being the topic exchange maybe maybe direct exchange

01:45.020 --> 01:47.430
and out exchange and so on.

01:48.130 --> 01:59.010
So again we can create topic exchange maybe and 4-D arguments we can just say example exchange

02:04.320 --> 02:06.210
just like that.

02:06.380 --> 02:11.560
And this was how we created our exchanges before.

02:11.660 --> 02:15.410
How about another way of creating exchanges.

02:15.410 --> 02:22.040
We have again an exchange builder class to create exchanges highly clear through way.

02:22.340 --> 02:26.050
So let's ride it out again.

02:26.300 --> 02:33.430
I'm creating a bean for my Xchange definition just as we did with cue's the cube builder.

02:33.770 --> 02:43.510
And I'm saying I want an exchange and this Xchange is going to be example.

02:43.850 --> 02:45.140
Second the exchange

02:48.980 --> 02:55.720
and inside the method I'm going to be creating my Xchange with the builder methods.

02:55.910 --> 03:08.300
So let's return Xchange builder from an Cupie core again and I want a direct exchange.

03:08.930 --> 03:21.430
And as the name I'm going to pro-white example seconder exchange and let's just capitalized name all

03:21.540 --> 03:29.940
right and then I'm going to say also do eat internal maybe.

03:30.370 --> 03:41.200
And I can of course provide arguments I can Pictet durability I can say ignore declaration exemptions

03:41.590 --> 03:46.100
and so on just like you see with the builder matters right here.

03:46.540 --> 03:53.860
And when I'm gone configuring my Xchange I can simply call the Builth method and I'm fine.

03:55.060 --> 04:03.340
That's it so now let's rerun our application and see what's going to happen.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.060
Our application is starting up

04:11.670 --> 04:13.380
and here we go.

04:14.120 --> 04:18.770
When we check out our logs we can see that we have an example.

04:18.810 --> 04:28.920
Second exchange created for us and let's go back to our Rabbitt MQ dashboard and see our exchanges there.

04:31.860 --> 04:41.580
Here we go we have our example exchange and we of course have our example secondo exchange just like

04:41.580 --> 04:43.670
we declare in our code.

04:43.860 --> 04:45.540
Right.

04:45.720 --> 04:55.530
And if we go back to our exchanges the example exchange is a topic exchange since we returned a new

04:55.530 --> 05:03.650
topic exchange and for the second exchange we have to be expecting a direct exchange with auto delete

05:03.880 --> 05:04.780
internal.

05:04.940 --> 05:15.920
And as to name example second exchange in our exchanges if we go to our example second exchange it is

05:15.920 --> 05:18.330
a direct exchange.

05:18.380 --> 05:19.530
It is durable.

05:19.640 --> 05:25.880
It is all to delete and of course it is internal Just like that.

05:26.190 --> 05:35.340
So these are how you can create exchanges with rabbit in Q In our next video we're going to be seeing

05:35.450 --> 05:41.180
halti configure topic exchanges fanout and headers exchanges.
