Nola's take a look at how we can create a header's exchange using the builder methods.

00:08.230 --> 00:12.030
So I'll go down again and our creative team.

00:12.310 --> 00:20.710
And with that being I'm going to say I want an exchange and this is going to be header's exchange

00:24.790 --> 00:27.670
an insight that header's exchange.

00:27.670 --> 00:38.200
I'm going to use the Xchange builder and I'll say header's exchange so as to name I'm going to say header's

00:38.200 --> 00:38.860
exchange

00:42.970 --> 00:51.280
and I can of course say header's test the exchange and then as we saw with the previous Xchange types

00:51.670 --> 00:57.910
the arguments are the builder method arguments are pretty simple because they're all extending from

00:57.910 --> 00:59.240
the same builder.

00:59.710 --> 01:07.540
We have internal we have durability auto delete delayed ignored declaration exceptions with arguments

01:07.540 --> 01:12.730
and with arguments as a map just like that.

01:12.820 --> 01:17.000
So let's say it is internal It is also durable

01:19.500 --> 01:28.280
and we can say ignore declaration exceptions and just be all that.

01:28.310 --> 01:37.840
So let's rerun our application to see created.

01:38.070 --> 01:41.910
It's about to start.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.800
And here we go.

01:44.180 --> 01:51.350
If you again check our logs we can see that are hundreds of exchanges created.

01:51.460 --> 02:02.170
And let's go to our rabbit MQ dashboard and in the exchanges we can definitely see that our headers

02:02.170 --> 02:11.200
test exchange is created as the type headers with the durability and the internal arguments set as true.

02:11.290 --> 02:19.090
And if we go inside it we can just simply verify that the arguments that we provided within the method

02:19.510 --> 02:23.860
is used when we create our Xchange in rabid MQ.
