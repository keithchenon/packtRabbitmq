NOLA sequel look at how to create a final exchange with the builder methods.

00:08.460 --> 00:20.580
So I'll go down here again and I'm going to create a bean and using the cupie core and all say fanout

00:21.280 --> 00:33.810
exchange and inside the method I'm going to build a panel exchange using the Xchange builder.

00:33.930 --> 00:44.330
I'll say fana the exchange and I'll provide fan out test the exchange and we have a typo there was just

00:44.340 --> 00:45.730
fixed up for a moment.

00:47.280 --> 00:56.520
And we have internal durability auto delete delete ignore declared exceptions.

00:56.610 --> 01:02.230
And again with argument and with arguments as a map.

01:02.310 --> 01:07.190
So pretty much similar to the other Xchange definitions.

01:07.260 --> 01:15.220
The key point here is that you have to provide specific arguments for your specific exchanges.

01:16.320 --> 01:23.680
That is basically the only difference when creating exchanges programmatically.

01:23.690 --> 01:33.190
So let's say you want an auto delete exchange if you want it durable as false.

01:33.400 --> 01:39.690
And we want it internal and then we're simply going to build it just like that.

01:41.660 --> 01:46.370
Let's rerun our application and see if it's going to be created.

01:49.130 --> 01:53.120
Our application is starting up.

01:53.370 --> 01:55.390
And here we go.

01:55.590 --> 01:56.950
Let's check out the logs.

01:57.090 --> 02:02.010
And we should see that our final text exchange is created.

02:02.400 --> 02:12.130
Let's go back to dashboard and as we can see that our final text exchange is right here.

02:12.350 --> 02:23.760
Set the auto delete as true and internal as true since a durability is set to false just like this here.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.850
It's not displayed there.

02:27.890 --> 02:29.360
Simple as that.

02:29.360 --> 02:35.900
So creating a final exchange with the builder method is pretty straightforward.

02:36.110 --> 02:37.340
Just as we saw here.
