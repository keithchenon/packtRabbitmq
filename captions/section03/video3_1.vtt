00:01.610 --> 00:09.480
Let's talk about what we're going to call We're in the section in this section we're going to learn

00:09.690 --> 00:14.790
what messaging means in software and why we actually need it.

00:15.300 --> 00:24.180
And as we were discussing the Qs and especially rubidium Q messaging is a very fundamental concept in

00:24.180 --> 00:25.480
this area.

00:25.650 --> 00:34.710
So we have to learn ins and outs of messaging and what it means in the MQ world.

00:34.770 --> 00:39.030
We're also going to talk about the messaging protocols that we have.

00:39.060 --> 00:47.920
And we can use in our applications and especially am Cupie and then we're going to dive deep into Amcu

00:48.030 --> 00:56.860
P And what is souls where us from a synchronous applications to where he efficient messaging pipelines

00:57.180 --> 01:04.000
and Cupie is going to help us so lots of great problems lots of huge problems actually.

01:04.440 --> 01:08.000
And then we're of course going to meet with rabbit.

01:08.010 --> 01:17.810
Q The King of the MQ world we're going to learn again ins and outs of rubidium Q and try to make yourself

01:18.050 --> 01:21.470
as much as we can inside of our applications.

01:23.800 --> 01:32.230
Then we're going to move on to pillars of messaging which are like cue's topics exchanges routeing and

01:32.230 --> 01:40.340
much more we're going to learn all the fundamental concepts of messaging and MQ world using the technologies

01:40.340 --> 01:44.050
of rabid MQ.

01:44.280 --> 01:51.130
We're going to make a comparison of message queuing protocols and messaging applications such as active

01:51.140 --> 01:52.300
MQ 0.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.260
Q camel rabbit.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.430
Q And so on.

01:55.590 --> 01:56.840
We're going to learn.

01:56.940 --> 02:02.660
Ups and downs pros and cons of these technologies and see were Robert M..

02:02.660 --> 02:06.940
Q fits in and will come to the understanding of that rabbit.

02:06.950 --> 02:12.780
Q is by far almost the best choice for any kind of application.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.530
Here we go.

02:14.720 --> 02:20.450
We have a huge list of topics that we're going to cover in the section starting with messaging.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.280
So so start with messaging.

02:23.420 --> 02:26.540
What it means in the world of software.

02:26.540 --> 02:27.890
I'll see on the next video.
