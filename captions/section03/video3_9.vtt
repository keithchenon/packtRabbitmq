00:01.520 --> 00:08.890
And next up we have topics topics are simply the subject part of the messages.

00:09.190 --> 00:15.860
The heading of the queue topics are defined as routing key for message Grubin.

00:15.970 --> 00:21.620
So with that routing key defined you can deliver your messages to proper cues and proper consumers.

00:22.490 --> 00:31.100
For routing key configuration there is a special formatting such as app that looks that error is a way

00:31.100 --> 00:32.780
of defining a topic.

00:32.780 --> 00:35.500
So you define your configuration as apt.

00:35.550 --> 00:41.740
Loxton error and you indicate that your topic is about application error logging.

00:41.780 --> 00:42.730
Simple as that.

00:44.530 --> 00:48.660
Of course there are optional parameters for message exchange.

00:48.670 --> 00:55.150
So while you're defining your topic you can have some optional parameters injected to your topic and

00:55.150 --> 00:56.200
queue definition.

00:56.410 --> 00:59.860
And we're definitely going to see that in the following lectures.

01:01.070 --> 01:05.530
You can send and receive messages without any topic information.

01:05.720 --> 01:11.850
So this is again the default exchange and default topic.

01:11.900 --> 01:18.380
You can simply send a message without indicating anything and your message is being delivered to default

01:18.380 --> 01:21.740
exchange and rabbit in queue with that default exchange.

01:21.980 --> 01:25.360
Then your message is being binded to default to that.

01:25.370 --> 01:31.540
With the full queue if the consumer is listening to that your consumer then can receive the message.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.510
Simple as that.

01:33.860 --> 01:38.220
Topic exchanges are defined using topics for message delivery.

01:38.270 --> 01:42.060
So this is the key concept from the default messaging.

01:42.500 --> 01:46.110
You have to define a topic to use a topic exchange.

01:46.130 --> 01:49.580
Otherwise there is no point in defining a topic exchange.
