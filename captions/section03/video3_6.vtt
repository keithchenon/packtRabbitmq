00:01.970 --> 00:07.620
So we are about to discover the pillars are the building blocks of rabbit.

00:07.620 --> 00:12.720
Q And these are exchanges cues topics and bindings.

00:12.980 --> 00:20.070
These are the foundational concepts in regard of rabid MQ or any AM keeps about four of them.

00:20.070 --> 00:27.390
Q These are very important concepts so I'd like you to pay very careful attention to this lecture.

00:27.500 --> 00:31.480
And if you need to please go back and watch it again.

00:31.850 --> 00:39.300
So let's start with four actors of messaging with rabid MQ in rabbit.

00:39.330 --> 00:47.850
Q We of course have a message producer this producer produces some form of message and this message

00:48.240 --> 00:59.010
is being sent to an Xchange this Xchange can be a default Xchange or a custom exchange that you created.

01:00.320 --> 01:10.730
I thought that from the exchange the message is it disrupting mechanism can be defined by you or by

01:10.980 --> 01:11.480
rabit them.

01:11.490 --> 01:21.610
Q As the default with this routeing defined your message is being delivered to a queue this queue is

01:21.850 --> 01:26.990
where the messages are piled up to be sent to the consumers.

01:27.270 --> 01:34.150
So when it reaches the queue it is being delivered to a consumer.

01:34.270 --> 01:38.740
The consumer is waiting there expecting the message.

01:38.810 --> 01:41.540
This can be a bad application.

01:41.680 --> 01:48.250
Some Java application or a simple command line application can be simply anything.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.640
So it is receiving the message at the end.

01:51.940 --> 02:02.290
This lifecycle of messages with rabid MQ using producer message and exchange routing a Q and A consumer

02:02.590 --> 02:04.900
is like an infinite lifecycle.

02:04.930 --> 02:12.340
All these processes and stages are rewind it and replay it whenever you send whenever you try to deliver

02:12.340 --> 02:13.470
a message.

02:13.510 --> 02:20.560
So let's just focus on foundational concepts that we see here and these are producers Xchange routings

02:20.560 --> 02:21.880
cues and consumers.
