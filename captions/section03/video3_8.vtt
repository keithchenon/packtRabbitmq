Next up we have cue's CU's are a core element in any MQ protocol but especially for rabit MQ It is the

00:11.940 --> 00:20.480
foundational element in Rabbitte MQ messages are routed to cues from exchanges just as we talked earlier

00:20.480 --> 00:21.450
about this.

00:21.590 --> 00:31.920
Messages are being routed to cues from exchanges using the bindings cues are simply like final destinations

00:31.920 --> 00:32.470
and rabbit.

00:32.490 --> 00:38.880
Q Before being received by subscribers this is a very key point here because your consumer only knows

00:38.880 --> 00:39.810
about the cues.

00:39.900 --> 00:42.660
They don't know about the exchange or anything else.

00:42.900 --> 00:48.810
They configured their client regarding just queue configuration and then they receive their messages

00:48.990 --> 00:50.180
from Bocuse.

00:51.460 --> 00:55.870
Routing algorithms depends on the Xchange type and rules called bindings.

00:56.170 --> 01:03.070
Just as we saw with the Xchange example and exchange definitions bindings are very important in rabit.

01:03.060 --> 01:10.530
Q You have to properly bind your exchanges and Qs so that your consumers can receive messages properly.

01:12.590 --> 01:17.610
Bindings are again simply used to bind exchanges to queues for message delivery.

01:17.630 --> 01:23.300
I'm pointing this out again and again just because you need to learn this because this is a very important

01:23.300 --> 01:30.770
concept in rabbit MQ bindings are being done from exchanges to accuse.

01:30.820 --> 01:34.120
So there are a couple of properties of a queue.

01:34.540 --> 01:37.150
And let's start one by one.

01:37.200 --> 01:42.360
Of course AQ is going to have a name the name of the Q that you define.

01:42.360 --> 01:46.500
You can define simply anything for your Q As the name.

01:46.500 --> 01:54.360
And there is the durability and the variable for that is call as durable durable state shrub it is cute

01:54.450 --> 01:57.810
that it should either persist your cue to the disk or not.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.740
So this is another important concept in rabbit.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.320
Q.

02:02.340 --> 02:06.210
You can have durable cues for later message delivery.

02:06.210 --> 02:10.020
This is about like retry mechanisms and failover mechanisms.

02:10.020 --> 02:15.600
This is an important concept and we're definitely going to get there in our following lectures.

02:15.600 --> 02:21.420
Just don't worry about it right now but you should know that you can have durable cues in your Xchange

02:22.900 --> 02:29.860
and there is a property as exclusive as seclusive simply defines that if there are no items in the queue

02:30.070 --> 02:35.060
and the queue can simply be deleted by the system by the rabid MQ.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.920
This is the flag for it.

02:38.850 --> 02:47.100
And there is also a flag as auto dash delete and this flag indicates rabbit named that the queue can

02:47.100 --> 02:51.210
be deleted when there are no consumer subscriptions.

02:51.300 --> 02:57.910
So simply if there are no consumer subscribe to your queue down your queue can be deleted by Robert

02:57.950 --> 02:59.700
MQ itself the Broecker itself.
