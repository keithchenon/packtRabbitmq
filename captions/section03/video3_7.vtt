00:00.480 --> 00:02.780
So let's start with exchanges.

00:04.890 --> 00:11.140
Exchanges are basically the actual am Cupie elements where messages are sent.

00:11.140 --> 00:19.800
At first just as we saw with the previous picture they take a message and route it into one or more

00:19.810 --> 00:20.190
cues.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.390
And this is a key concept.

00:22.510 --> 00:28.990
You can just send a message to an exchange and from that exchange your message can be routed to a single

00:28.990 --> 00:30.900
queue or multiple cues.

00:30.910 --> 00:33.590
And this is a great feature of rabbit.

00:33.590 --> 00:43.270
Q And routing algorithm decides where to send messages from exchange routing algorithm is built into

00:43.360 --> 00:50.640
rabit MQ and when you provide the configuration of your exchange to route messages to the queues that

00:50.670 --> 00:57.320
you're interested in those messages are properly delivered to the Qs that you wanted to send.

00:57.330 --> 00:58.500
Simple as that.

00:59.530 --> 01:07.030
And these routing algorithms depend on the Xchange type and rules called as bindings these bindings

01:07.030 --> 01:14.260
are the actual configurations that I was just talking about when you configure your bindings for exchanges

01:14.260 --> 01:17.040
to cues you tie them somehow.

01:17.050 --> 01:23.890
And when you want to send a message your message is first getting to the Xchange and after the exchange

01:24.190 --> 01:29.890
your message is being delivered to a queue using the binding configuration.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.860
This is where the tying glue.

01:31.870 --> 01:39.480
This is where the action going on within the exchange and the queue bindings are simply used to bind

01:39.560 --> 01:42.810
exchanges to queues for message delivery.

01:42.810 --> 01:43.960
This is the key concept.

01:44.070 --> 01:51.600
Just as I was talking with the previous ballpoints here bindings are the glues to halt exchanges and

01:51.600 --> 01:56.260
queues all together to deliver your messages to the consumers.

01:58.340 --> 02:07.310
There are simply four exchange types and first up is direct exchange direct exchange is simply an empty

02:07.310 --> 02:12.440
string or am Cupie that direct direction for any exchange.

02:12.440 --> 02:18.620
This is basically the default exchange that I was talking about in our previous slides in previous lectures.

02:18.950 --> 02:21.230
This is where the messages are delivered.

02:21.230 --> 02:26.600
Then you say no binding or no configuration to your exchange or que.

02:26.690 --> 02:30.840
After that we have found out the exchange into default.

02:30.830 --> 02:35.640
It is defined as an Cupie Dalfin out as the name suggests.

02:35.670 --> 02:42.560
For now the exchanges are being used as the message distribution to everywhere for all the bindings

02:42.560 --> 02:44.650
that your exchange has.

02:44.660 --> 02:49.100
Your messages are being spread out all the queues with your bindings.

02:49.100 --> 02:56.900
This is simply a final exchange a topic exchange is being defined as an adult that topic as default

02:57.520 --> 03:01.070
and of course you can choose the topic that you want to send.

03:01.070 --> 03:07.550
The topic exchange a key point in the topic exchange is you define a topic and you send your message

03:07.610 --> 03:09.430
using that topic.

03:09.470 --> 03:15.830
Let's suppose you're running a e-commerce site and your customer just purchased an item from your store

03:16.430 --> 03:23.090
and you want to notify some other part of your system about this customer purchase and you have a topic

03:23.270 --> 03:31.010
named as customer purchased and when you send your message with the topic exchange with this topic your

03:31.010 --> 03:35.780
message is being delivered to the Conservative Party over your messaging system.

03:35.780 --> 03:43.530
So topic exchange is simply like the specific way of delivering messages in an Cupie.

03:43.550 --> 03:51.020
Finally we have header's exchange headboards exchange are basically the way to exchange headers with

03:51.020 --> 04:00.170
messages in AM Cupie And of course with rabid MQ you exchange messages and you want to just maybe exchange

04:00.170 --> 04:06.420
your headers with other messages and other queues and exchanges or maybe other consumers.

04:06.440 --> 04:13.880
This is the way to exchange messages for headers in rabbit named Q And for the default you can use and

04:13.900 --> 04:21.360
Cupie up match or and keep the data headers and some specific or custom header that you want to provide.
