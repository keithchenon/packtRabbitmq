00:01.540 --> 00:05.000
So we're finished with our rabid MQ curse.

00:05.110 --> 00:11.800
And I think you enjoy that and you're going to use the examples and the methodology and you're both

00:11.830 --> 00:15.500
professional and personal projects.

00:15.590 --> 00:19.510
So I'd like to thank you very much for joining me in this course.

00:22.340 --> 00:28.330
With this cause I think you're going to be sharing much more with your existing implementations.

00:28.340 --> 00:35.970
And of course with the feature ones that you're thinking in your mind you did they were a good job of

00:36.180 --> 00:43.110
faking discourse and I hope you learned a lot from the scores and make sure to go over lectures again

00:43.110 --> 00:46.210
and again to grasp all the concepts about rabid.

00:46.220 --> 00:50.740
Q And of course this is not everything about rabbit.

00:50.740 --> 00:58.260
Q There are much more advanced messaging scenarios and patterns using rabbit in Q and Amcu protocols.

00:59.370 --> 01:06.510
I'm planning to make a course about these advanced techniques on message patterns and messaging systems.

01:06.630 --> 01:10.350
But before I start I want to do a poll about this.

01:10.440 --> 01:17.370
And considering your answers to my poll I'm going to be preparing and other course containing the enterprise

01:17.370 --> 01:26.470
messaging systems messaging designs and patterns with rabbit MQ.

01:26.500 --> 01:34.390
And finally I'd like to thank my wife supporting me in this course to create and to help me she this

01:35.600 --> 01:35.820
so.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.230
Thank you very much again.

01:37.450 --> 01:39.930
And I hope to see you on the next course.
