To instill rabid MQ on Mac OS Let's first search for rabbit MQ

00:09.500 --> 00:11.300
and into results.

00:11.450 --> 00:16.750
Let's just go to download and installation in the downloads section.

00:16.910 --> 00:21.490
Let's select the Mac OS and we have couple of options here.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.100
First one is homebrew.

00:23.150 --> 00:27.230
There are a standalone and the generic Unix.

00:27.230 --> 00:29.080
So the best option.

00:29.210 --> 00:37.250
You should also use and I recommend is the homebrew option while depending on the system that you have

00:37.470 --> 00:42.390
Hambro is the actually missing package manager for Mac OS.

00:42.440 --> 00:47.240
So let's take a look at the web page of homebrew to learn more about it.

00:47.750 --> 00:54.380
And as you can see it has the web page as Brue that SH The Homebrew.

00:54.380 --> 00:58.980
As I said the missing package manager for Mac OS to install it.

00:59.060 --> 01:07.610
All you have to do is just copy the script and run in your command line or a terminal in Mac OS and

01:07.820 --> 01:11.220
after finishing with the homebrew installation.

01:11.570 --> 01:16.300
Just go back to rabid MQ and follow the way with Brou.

01:16.320 --> 01:23.840
As for doing that since I already have homebrew in my machine I'll just open up a terminal window and

01:23.840 --> 01:30.920
I'll just follow the lines follow the guidelines from rabbit him Q So to do that all first update my

01:30.920 --> 01:31.370
brew

01:36.550 --> 01:45.040
and then I'm simply going to bruv install and rabid MQ

01:50.880 --> 01:57.550
and rabbit MQ is being downloaded and installed.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.750
All right I'll rub it in.

01:59.750 --> 02:03.330
Q. installation on Mac OS is now complete.

02:03.380 --> 02:10.690
So to check out Raben MQ management UI and to start with rabid MQ command line interface.

02:10.850 --> 02:12.680
I'll be seeing you on the next with is.
