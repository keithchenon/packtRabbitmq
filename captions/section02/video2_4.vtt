00:01.080 --> 00:07.830
All right we have completed installations of rabbit MQ server on our systems both on Windows and Mac

00:07.830 --> 00:11.440
OS so to do well with Robert M..

00:11.430 --> 00:19.890
Q And start discovering it will first have to start our rabid enqueue server on our machine to do that.

00:19.920 --> 00:25.720
Locate the binary installation of rabid MQ and to do that.

00:25.960 --> 00:34.660
I'll just go to user folder and local and Espen underspin.

00:34.980 --> 00:43.740
If I do and LS I'll see that my rubidium Q bash scripts are located to start our server.

00:44.030 --> 00:49.110
I'll say as h rabbit m q server.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.590
Simple as that so I'll hit enter.

00:54.360 --> 01:01.570
And our broker is being started and it is complete with 6 additional plugins.

01:02.680 --> 01:11.730
So to checkout if our manager plug in is also enabled I'll open a new tab and from there I'll say localhost

01:12.370 --> 01:17.930
and 1 5 6 7 2 as the pork I'll hit enter.

01:18.280 --> 01:24.760
And here we go our management plug in is also enabled so we can see the management UI dashboard from

01:24.760 --> 01:25.670
here.

01:25.690 --> 01:27.330
Simple as that.

01:27.400 --> 01:35.280
So in case you can't see this page even if you started with your broker all you have to do is type this

01:35.280 --> 01:42.340
command and I'll show you now the command for doing this is.

01:42.720 --> 01:48.870
First you have to of course locate the sh scripts of rabbit MQ binary packages.

01:49.110 --> 01:57.270
To do that you have to go to the user folder local and Espin in there you should see Raben MQ scripts

01:57.300 --> 02:01.820
and files to enable your plugin for management.

02:02.200 --> 02:11.710
You have to type SH rabid MQ plug ins and enable management plugin

02:15.360 --> 02:18.650
that's all in case you don't see the screen.

02:18.690 --> 02:25.650
Please use this command and I'll share this command in my description so you can just copy and paste

02:25.650 --> 02:29.520
it so that you can enable your management UI.

02:29.670 --> 02:38.180
So let's go back to our management UI on management you I to log into our rocker to our rabid MQ server

02:38.780 --> 02:42.420
we have some defaults and to learn those defaults.

02:42.530 --> 02:48.320
Let's go back to our instillation page and check out our default user access.

02:48.320 --> 02:54.720
And as you can see a broker creates a user as guest and with password guest.

02:54.770 --> 03:02.520
So let's use those and logon to our Ibidem Q and guests.

03:02.540 --> 03:03.450
Here we go.

03:04.760 --> 03:13.760
We have all logged into our Rabbitt MQ server as you can see our dashboard is very comprehensive and

03:13.970 --> 03:16.720
detailed also useful dashboard.

03:17.030 --> 03:22.430
So let's start by discovering what it has and what it's doing for us.

03:22.430 --> 03:26.650
First we have our overview page in this overview page.

03:26.720 --> 03:36.380
We have the queued messages and the message ratios and the currently idle broker sites we have the connections

03:36.380 --> 03:37.270
listed here.

03:37.340 --> 03:45.980
Channels exchange queues and if any consumers there they will be displayed right here right below that.

03:46.090 --> 03:49.270
We have our node which is provided by Robert M..

03:49.270 --> 03:58.210
Q So when we launch it in there we have the memory usage number of processes and a disk space that we

03:58.210 --> 04:01.450
have on the top.

04:01.510 --> 04:09.550
We have the connections tap in the connections that if we had any We will be seeing the active connections

04:09.550 --> 04:14.830
to our broker either from the consumer or from the publisher.

04:15.190 --> 04:18.290
And in the next step we have channels.

04:18.580 --> 04:23.210
These channels are simply the messaging channels provided by rabit him.

04:23.210 --> 04:26.390
Q And will dig in to that in the later sections.

04:27.340 --> 04:34.410
In the next step we have exchanges and as you can see as we discussed in our previous lectures these

04:34.410 --> 04:37.040
are difficult exchanges from Rabbitt them.

04:37.050 --> 04:45.390
Q provided to us so that we can by default in it all kind of topics and exchanges as you can see we

04:45.390 --> 04:49.410
have Amcu P default as a direct type of exchange.

04:49.530 --> 04:51.620
We have an Kopete direct.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.700
We have an Cupie fan out.

04:53.700 --> 05:02.310
We have headers and all those different types of exchange provided for us and in the Two-Step you will

05:02.310 --> 05:06.140
be seeing all the cues that we have created for us.

05:06.300 --> 05:07.490
But since there are none.

05:07.490 --> 05:17.460
For now we're not assuming anything and it says no Qs and in the admin section we can manage users will

05:17.480 --> 05:21.260
house limits and clustering mechanisms of rabbit.

05:21.270 --> 05:30.080
Q You can't simply just create users and as you can see here at a user and you can define the management

05:30.080 --> 05:36.770
type of the user as admin monitoring and other things that we can see here.

05:36.770 --> 05:42.320
Also you can manage policies for queuing and message broker limits.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.550
And again clustering.

05:46.600 --> 05:52.720
So this is the general look of rabbit MQ management plug in and we're going to be making use of it very

05:52.720 --> 05:54.370
much in our lectures.
