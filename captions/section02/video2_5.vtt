00:01.200 --> 00:08.460
Know it's time that we create our first cue exchange and binding between them to do that.

00:08.490 --> 00:09.790
I have my rabbit.

00:09.790 --> 00:13.030
MQ management you I open running in front of me.

00:14.400 --> 00:20.020
So let's go to exchanges first and create an exchange for us.

00:20.130 --> 00:23.180
So all hit at a new exchange.

00:23.220 --> 00:34.500
And as the name let's say this is a testy exchange and let's just say the type will be tracked and durability

00:34.770 --> 00:36.930
is durable by default.

00:36.930 --> 00:39.650
So I'm not touching it at all.

00:39.710 --> 00:42.210
Delete as know no in total as.

00:42.210 --> 00:42.910
No.

00:42.990 --> 00:49.530
And there are no arguments for now and just don't worry about the details right now and I'll just simply

00:49.530 --> 00:51.570
hit and exchange to create it.

00:54.000 --> 00:54.930
Here we go.

00:54.930 --> 00:58.970
We have our exchanges created right here.

00:59.300 --> 01:04.910
And as you can see it has a section named as bindings which has none right now.

01:05.040 --> 01:13.070
And we can publish messages to this exchange and we can just delete the exchange altogether.

01:13.100 --> 01:20.860
So let's go and create a queue right now to bind us to Xchange on the QS page.

01:21.010 --> 01:29.200
I'll hit add in new Q And of course I'm going to say this is a test too and it is of course durable

01:29.740 --> 01:36.850
and for the arguments I have nothing right now I'll be using those arguments and making use of them

01:37.090 --> 01:40.380
in the later sections when we're implementing our applications.

01:40.420 --> 01:42.160
So I'll just hit add.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.920
Q Here we go.

01:44.920 --> 01:51.190
Our queue is ready to get messages from our exchange.

01:51.270 --> 02:00.740
So let's go back to our exchanges and from our text exchange let's add a binding to the queue.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.140
We just created.

02:02.550 --> 02:14.090
So I'll just bind this exchange to the queue which is test queue and the binding key is not required.

02:14.090 --> 02:19.460
So I'm just leaving it that just as is and I'll just hit bind.

02:19.910 --> 02:21.190
Here we go.

02:21.260 --> 02:23.440
Our rebinding is now this way.

02:23.450 --> 02:26.700
Right here as you can see.

02:26.750 --> 02:37.460
So let's go and publish a message to our exchange and see if it is being taken by the test you so I'm

02:37.460 --> 02:50.730
not providing any routing key but I'm just saying hi and hi from rabid MQ course just like that.

02:50.930 --> 02:57.050
I'm not adding any other property under saying in the message body which is payload.

02:57.050 --> 03:01.580
In this case and I'm just going to publish this message.

03:01.580 --> 03:06.400
So let's hit publish message and here we go.

03:06.430 --> 03:16.230
We have our popup notification saying as message published Let's go to our queue and in our queue as

03:16.230 --> 03:23.730
you can see we have a total of one message and that one is ready to see that message.

03:24.030 --> 03:26.100
Let's click on our test queue.

03:26.610 --> 03:34.500
And in the test queue as you can see from the queued message Charke right here we have ASPI that Spike

03:34.500 --> 03:37.910
is generated when we published our message.

03:37.950 --> 03:45.830
And as you can see we have a total of one messages in our queue to get that message to see the message.

03:45.990 --> 03:51.340
Let's go in click get messages and I'll hit get messages.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.720
And here we go.

03:54.970 --> 04:02.150
We can see our message to our published message in rabbit m q q and which was high from Ibidem.

04:02.150 --> 04:04.540
Q As simple as that.

04:06.230 --> 04:12.650
And apart from publishing and seeing this message from an exchange with binding to AQ.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.470
We have a couple of other alternatives that we can use.

04:17.520 --> 04:21.450
We have consumers that we can see if there are any.

04:21.450 --> 04:27.900
In our case there are none right now and we can see the bindings which was with the test Xchange from

04:27.900 --> 04:28.270
the test.

04:28.280 --> 04:38.070
Q As you can see here and we can also again publish messages to our queue directly from this interface

04:39.000 --> 04:46.980
and we can move messages around queues and exchanges and we can also delete the queue entirely and we

04:46.980 --> 04:53.340
can use the purge option for messages inside queue which is just simply deleting all the messages waiting

04:53.340 --> 04:56.520
for the consumers to process in the queue.

04:57.090 --> 05:04.200
And we can also see the runtime metrics for our queue which is a very detailed option for tracking your

05:04.200 --> 05:07.920
queue and the consumer traffic.

05:07.940 --> 05:14.670
So I hope this is a good introduction to management UI and creating our first Q And Exchange with a

05:14.690 --> 05:15.860
binding and rabbit name.

05:15.860 --> 05:19.430
Q And I think this is a very useful exercise.

05:20.320 --> 05:25.910
I highly encourage you to do the same in your environment and I'll be seeing you on the next section.
