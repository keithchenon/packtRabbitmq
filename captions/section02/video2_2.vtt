00:01.730 --> 00:04.220
So let's start by installing Rabbie them.

00:04.220 --> 00:07.730
Q On Windows specifically Windows 10.

00:07.880 --> 00:21.220
So I'm opening up a browser window and from there I'm going to search for rabbit MQ.

00:21.330 --> 00:29.220
After that I'm going to the download section of the official website and from there I'm going to go

00:29.220 --> 00:31.780
to windows with installer.

00:32.190 --> 00:34.460
This is the easiest way to install rabbit.

00:34.470 --> 00:35.720
Q On Windows.

00:35.820 --> 00:43.170
So I'm picking any of them because they are both identical just different sources and I'm downloading

00:43.170 --> 00:43.610
it.

00:46.210 --> 00:46.530
OK.

00:46.530 --> 00:53.800
It is being downloaded and as you can see we have to install Erlang on our computer so that rubidium

00:53.830 --> 00:55.230
Q can read properly.

00:55.260 --> 00:58.380
Otherwise it just simply doesn't work.

00:58.380 --> 01:05.640
So to do that as we see the direction right here let's just go to download of Earthlink for windows

01:06.600 --> 01:11.160
and from there I'm just going to simply download Irwig

01:14.420 --> 01:18.210
and I'll pick the 64 bit version.

01:21.740 --> 01:23.180
All right.

01:23.180 --> 01:29.930
So what we should do now is we need to wait for download of the Earthling and then when you first install

01:29.950 --> 01:30.610
Erlang.

01:30.800 --> 01:36.120
And after that we will install rabit MQ itself.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.080
All right.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.110
Download our Erlang distribution is complete.

01:40.390 --> 01:42.530
So now let's install it.

01:42.610 --> 01:43.570
I'm going to hit run

01:46.200 --> 01:48.430
and select Yes.

01:48.990 --> 01:57.810
And from there I'm not picking anything and I'm going to go with the default installation and hit next.

01:57.820 --> 01:58.630
All right.

01:58.720 --> 02:07.030
It is being installed and it is prompting me to install C++ distribution and also install that because

02:07.090 --> 02:14.610
it's also a required component.

02:14.620 --> 02:15.250
All right.

02:15.550 --> 02:17.500
It's complete.

02:17.500 --> 02:26.080
So now our Erlang installation is going on.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.280
All right.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.090
Erlang is installed.

02:29.120 --> 02:33.480
Now let's close this and run the rabid MQ server installation.

02:33.700 --> 02:44.130
I'll hit Grun and select Yes and from there I'm going to install rabid MQ as a service which is the

02:44.310 --> 02:51.630
point of this installer so I'll just pick none and the default is selected right here as you can see.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.190
And I'm going to hit next.

02:54.040 --> 02:54.880
And install

02:58.060 --> 03:05.300
and on just going to allow every connection for Erlang to have the rabbit key working properly.

03:05.320 --> 03:14.050
So say allow access and again I'm going to do that for the distribution.

03:14.170 --> 03:15.300
And here we go.

03:16.170 --> 03:16.800
Rabbit.

03:16.820 --> 03:19.510
Q installation is now complete.

03:21.660 --> 03:29.490
To verify that if it's installed properly and working properly as a service I'll just go to search and

03:29.880 --> 03:31.740
look for services.

03:35.170 --> 03:36.610
And here we go.

03:37.490 --> 03:44.710
And in there I'm going to look for Ibidem Q And as you can see here a rabbit named Q is now running

03:45.430 --> 03:49.180
rabbit MQ server is running in Windows as a service.
