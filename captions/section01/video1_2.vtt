00:01.990 --> 00:05.290
Now let's talk about what we're going to cover in this course

00:08.450 --> 00:16.490
and this scores we're going to start by the way basic the fundamental model which for any message broker

00:17.750 --> 00:19.410
and that is messaging.

00:19.760 --> 00:26.810
So we're going to start by what the messaging means in software world and why we actually need it.

00:28.760 --> 00:34.460
And after that we're going to take a look at messaging protocols such as MQ T.T.

00:37.860 --> 00:44.790
after we finish with the protocols we're going to take a closer look at the AMD Cupie a synchronous

00:44.790 --> 00:49.340
message queuing protocol.

00:49.450 --> 00:53.790
And finally we're going to meet wet rabbit.

00:53.790 --> 01:04.590
Q The popular message queuing protocol for almost any environment that we have and after we first met

01:04.620 --> 01:14.740
with Rabbitt MQ we're going to start with cue's topics exchange and more we're going to learn the fundamental

01:14.740 --> 01:16.390
concepts of rubidium.

01:17.020 --> 01:20.750
And these are were important topics in the scores.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.440
I can't stress this enough.

01:22.450 --> 01:29.410
So make sure to study these sections very well because we're going to use that information throughout

01:29.410 --> 01:30.190
the course.

01:32.120 --> 01:39.290
After we learn the fundamentals of rabbit him Q and messaging we're going to take a comparison of message

01:39.290 --> 01:49.730
queueing frameworks and applications such as Kafka kÃ¼mmel rabbit MQ Actium Q and more.

01:49.900 --> 01:58.120
After we finish our discussions about exchanges cue's bindings and much more we're going to start implementing

01:58.420 --> 02:08.700
rabbit MQ with our code using of course Jawa and springe we will learn how to use rabbit template for

02:08.700 --> 02:12.700
sending both simple and complex messages.

02:13.050 --> 02:16.480
I'll be showing you all the ways of using rabbit.

02:16.770 --> 02:24.200
And just wait up for that after we learn how to send messages with rabit template.

02:24.490 --> 02:32.440
We're going to move forward with our implementations such as configuring Qs exchanges bindings and much

02:32.440 --> 02:33.810
more from code.

02:34.120 --> 02:41.230
We're going to be implementing listeners and many other constructs of rabbit named Q so that we can

02:41.230 --> 02:44.780
use it in our both professional and personal projects.

02:47.700 --> 02:54.720
After learning how to configure queues ex-Rangers bindings and much more we're going to realize an asynchronous

02:54.720 --> 03:00.060
scenario with two different applications from one application.

03:00.060 --> 03:08.590
We're going to be publishing a message to a specific routing key and an Xchange from the other application.

03:08.670 --> 03:13.210
We're going to be receiving that message and processing it.

03:13.400 --> 03:18.270
It's going to be a very useful exercise and I'll be expecting to see you there.

03:21.800 --> 03:26.110
So without further ado I'll be seeing you on the next section.
